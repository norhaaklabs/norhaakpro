      <description>One of the rules I learned is to avoid being a martyr. Especially when you are trying to make an impact in life.
What&amp;rsquo;s being going on with Julian ASSANGE is crazy to say the least, but he breached that rule. Never try to be a martyr.
It is simple as; either you have power and control, so you are able to change the course of things. Either you are not in control, in this case you better keep you line and mouth shut.</description>

      <description>Yes, that is a question we must answer first before you get to know us more.
NorHaak is the name of this company, and too much thinkering has been done to compress our mission statement and raison d&amp;rsquo;etre in a single word.
Nor for the northern star, as a universal guidance in darker nights, darker times.
Nor is also the root of the name Mounir. It means light in Arabic.</description>
