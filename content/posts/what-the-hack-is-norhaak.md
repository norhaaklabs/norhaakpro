Yes, that is a question we must answer first before you get to know us more.

NorHaak is the name of this company, and too much thinkering has been done to compress our mission statement and raison d'etre in a single word.

Nor for the northern star, as a universal guidance in darker nights, darker times.

Nor is also the root of the name Mounir. It means light in Arabic.

Haak for hackers mindset.

The motto is simple; we make it work, we make it right, finally we make it fast.

NorHaak stands for many things:
* A light torch in darker nights, darker places
* The light of righfulness, when you are rightful, your journey is enlighted. You know where your are headed, it's clear.

Our mission in life is simple: to help save as much lives as possible. So help us God!
