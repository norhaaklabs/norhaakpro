One of the rules I learned is to avoid being a martyr. Especially when you are trying to make an impact in life.

What's being going on with Julian ASSANGE is crazy to say the least, but he breached that rule. Never try to be a martyr.

It is simple as; either you have power and control, so you are able to change the course of things. Either you are not in control, in this case you better keep you line and mouth shut.

I think Linus Torvalds is believed to have said something along this line: Real men put their code (insert here whatever you want) in a public FTP server.

Julian choose the other way around.
It's too bad, but for every game there are rules.
He should have known better.

OK. let's join the chorus; FREE ASSANGE.
JOURNALISM IS NOT A CRIME.
